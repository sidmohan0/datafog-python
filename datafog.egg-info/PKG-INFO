# DataFog

DataFog (or the product formerly known as Codexify) is a Python package that simplifies and automates data anonymization tasks. With DataFog, you can quickly scan your datasets for Personal Identifiable Information (PII), swap PII with synthetic data, save and look up original and synthetic data pairs, and more.

## Libraries Used
* [faker](www.github.com/joke2k/faker) for Synthetic Data Generation
* Boilerplate PII detection code (swapping in with a custom solution soon)

## Coming Soon:
* product demo
* documentation
* `examples/` directory for more detailed examples and usage information

## Installation

DataFog can be installed via pip. Use the following command to install:

```bash
pip install datafog
```

## Getting Started

Once you've installed DataFog, you can import it into your Python scripts as follows:

```python
from datafog import DataFog
```

Now, you're ready to use DataFog to handle your PII anonymization needs. Here are some basic examples:

**Scan a dataset for PII:**

```python
datafog = DataFog()

# Scan a csv file for PII
contains_pii, pii_fields = datafog.scan("path_to_your_file.csv")

# Print the result
print(f"Contains PII: {contains_pii}")
print(f"PII Fields: {pii_fields}")
```

**Swap PII with synthetic data:**

```python
# Define the output path
output_path = "path_to_output_directory/"

# Swap PII in a csv file with synthetic data
datafog.swap("path_to_your_file.csv", output_path)
```
